## Thursday, May 21st

#### Today we covered:

* How awful Comcast's internet is (sorry, y'all!)
* Google Web Fonts
    * "Quick Add"
    * Copy `<link>` tag
    * Add to CSS like normal (`font-family: "Open Sans"`)
* `<input>`
    * Representation determined by `type` attribute
    * Use the `name` attribute to make `<form>` submission pay attention
    * `type=radio`: only one selected per `name`
    * `type=checkbox`: multiple selected by `name`
* CSS transitions
    * On element: `transition: all 2s` for 2 second duration
    * For some additional state (`:hover`) add different CSS properties
